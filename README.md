## Introduction
Memory Match is a modern card‑flipping game built in React that challenges players to find matching pairs. It includes difficulty levels, a timer, move tracking, and best‑time persistence.

## Technologies
* HTML — layout structure
* CSS — custom lilac/lavender UI theme
* React (CDN + Babel) — game logic and state management (card flips, matches, timer, score)
* LocalStorage — best time per difficulty

## Features
* True memory‑match gameplay with flip‑back logic
* Difficulty selector (4x4 and 6x4)
* Timer, move counter, and best‑time tracking
* Reset/start flow for new rounds
* Responsive grid layout

## How It Works
1. Choose a difficulty and press Start / Reset.
2. Flip two cards to find matching pairs.
3. Mismatched cards flip back after a short delay.
4. Timer stops when all pairs are matched and best time is saved.
